Achieving minimal competency in federal contracting requires navigating complex internal and external business functions, financial capital and accounting requirements, technical qualifications, and stringent government regulations. This cumulative burden creates a significant barrier that many small businesses struggle to overcome.

At the same time, the federal government has a vested interest in fostering greater small business participation. Expanding opportunities for small businesses enhances competition, drives innovation, and strengthens domestic economic resilience—critical components of an efficient and effective public procurement system. Given this inherent governmental interest, it is both logical and necessary to implement targeted support mechanisms that enable small businesses to compete on a level playing field.

To reduce barriers to entry, the federal government should establish grant programs that provide small businesses with essential resources, including legal assistance, business development guidance, compliance training, and marketplace navigation support. These grants would not only help small businesses bridge the knowledge and financial gaps that currently limit their participation but also ensure that federal procurement reflects a diverse and competitive supplier base.

By directly investing in small business readiness, the government can accelerate economic growth, promote supplier diversity, and ultimately achieve greater efficiency in federal contracting. Establishing these grant programs is a strategic and necessary step toward reducing the systemic barriers that prevent small businesses from successfully engaging in the federal marketplace.","Administrative burden of registration and compliance, Knowledge gap about federal procurement processes","Centralized ""getting started"" portal with step-by-step guidance, Mentorship programs with experienced contractors, Plain language guides to requirements",Understanding solicitation requirements

We got our GSA contract because we were told they want to buy that way, it cost us $10k in legal fees and 13 months from submission to award to get the contract. During that time the HQ element  mandated the our end user that many of our products must be purchased on DLA, even though we went through the process to get our GSA contract.
